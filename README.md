This game was developed for the [Eggplant Podcast](https://eggplant.show)'s 21st game jam which you can check out on [Itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/eggjam-21).

Portions of the game were developed live on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/kevinmakesgames) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@kevinmakesgames/streams). Archived streams should be available on the latter.

If you have any questions about the game feel free to message me on [Twitter](https://x.com/kevinthompson) or [Mastodon](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@kevin)!
